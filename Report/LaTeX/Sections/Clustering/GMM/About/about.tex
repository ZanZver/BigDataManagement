\subsubsection{About}

Gaussian Mixture Model (or GMM) is clustering algorithm \parencite{reynolds2009gaussian} that assumes data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Model is trained by expectation maximization based algorithm. Underneath we are trying to predict what is the likelihood of an item to appear in our data.

Pyspark MLlib library was used for implementation of the model as well.
