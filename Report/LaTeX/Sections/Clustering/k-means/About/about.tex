\subsubsection{About}

K-means is a clustering algorithm \parencite{hartigan1979algorithm}. It is one of the more popular algorithms used for clustering. How it usually works is by us providing k (number of clusters) to the algorithm. Our model will then calculate the distance (there are different calculations: Euclidean, Manhattan, etc...) between nodes. Afterwards we can see the ideal number and chose it as our number of clusters.
