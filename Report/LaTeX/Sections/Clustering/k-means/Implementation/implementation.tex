\subsubsection{Implementation}

In order to create the model, we pass in number of clusters, training and testing data to the function. In a similar way as with classification, the model is build in order to classify team strength. At the end, model is fitted and predictions are returned.

MLlib library from PySpark was used for kmeans model.

    assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['strength'], outputCol='features')

    x_train = assembler.transform(train_df).select('features')
    x_test = assembler.transform(test_df).select('features')

    kmeans = KMeans(k=k, seed=42)

    model = kmeans.fit(x_train)

    predictions = model.transform(x_test)

    return predictions
