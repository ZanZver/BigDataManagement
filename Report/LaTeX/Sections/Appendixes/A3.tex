\subsection{A3}\label{A3}

Steps of building the model are similar to classification. The main difference is that we are using clustering algorithms which have different parameters. One of the parameters is number of classes. This depends on the model and data, we can say that we have 3 classes at all the times. Other approach is for model to figure out how many classes should be on its own.
