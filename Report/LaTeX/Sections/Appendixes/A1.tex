\subsection{A1}\label{A1}

Docker is a containerisation system \parencite{docker2020docker}. It is similar to virtualisation, but it is more efficient due to sharing of resources (especially by sharing kernel).

In our case, we have used docker-compose, which is markup language, in order to define our 4 environments. All of the environments were then executed at the same time.

Note that there was a limit set for RAM. Developer system was lacking resources, therefore it needed to be capped at around 3-4GB of ram per container.
