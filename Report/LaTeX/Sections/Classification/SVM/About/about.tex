\subsubsection{About}

SVM (Support Vector Machines) works by, simply put, dividing the data into categories \parencite{wang2005comparison}. This is done with "drawing the line" on the grid.

Example bellow showcases how two classes are divided by the model.

As with decision tree, we have used same library in order to get SVM model.
