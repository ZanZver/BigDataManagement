Looking over the time series, graph is similar to ad-clicks in terms of decline.

Investigating which team has bought the most items, we can see that team with id 27 is the top spender although it is only 3rd one in terms of team members. The second biggest spender, team 64, has the most members. This would put team 27 in odd position since they appear to be the perfect team (quite big and they spend the most).

Creating a correlation chart between team, price and buy ID shows us that team is not correlated to anything. On the other hand, buy id and price seems to be heavily correlated which we have confirmed with missing data in Combined data section (Figure \ref{fig:combinedData_msno}).
