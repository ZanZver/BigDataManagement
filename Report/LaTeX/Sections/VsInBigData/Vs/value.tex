\subsection{Value}\label{Value}

Value provides business insights of the data. This can be interpreted in a number of ways, such as most of the players are from US therefore lets focus our infrastructure there, a lot of players seem to click on technology related ads lets expand that, etc....

Data can provide different value to the company. It all depends on context and analysts extracting it.

In our case, the biggest value it provides is players. With it we can see where they are from, age, platform, etc... Chat data is available as well but it doesn't provide as much details for us but for players it is a lot more important since they can communicate between each other.
Value can also be added from external sources. For example, we have Twitter handles in our data. We could expand our dataset by doing text mining on each users Twitter profile in order to server them personalised advertisements. This would increase our data value and financial gain as a company.
