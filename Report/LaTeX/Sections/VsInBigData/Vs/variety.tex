\subsection{Variety}\label{Variety}

Variety describes the kind of data we are dealing with. This can be from text, to video, sound, etc... Different files carry different burdens, for example file size. Video platform (such as YouTube) is distributing mainly video formats \parencite{hota2018big}, therefore they need a different infrastructure compared to text based website (such as Stack overflow).

As seen in table above (\ref{FileSizes}), we are mainly dealing with CSV files. This is represented in semi structured form since we can link items together. In the processing stage, files could be change to different format in order to save space (example: Parquett with Apache Hudi).
