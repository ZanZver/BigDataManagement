\section{Graph analysis}\label{GraphAnalysis}
Graph databases are part of NoSQL (also known as NotOnlySQL). They don't represent tables and relations.

There are different NoSQL databases (MariaDB, Cassandra, MarkLogic, etc...), each one is focusing on its own solution. MariaDB is document oriented, but in our case we are using Neo4j \parencite{miller2013graph} which is graph database. Instead of tables and relations, we have nodes and edges. Another change is language. Queries are not written/executed in SQL but with Cypher.

Setup of the database can be seen at \ref{A4} and data used in \ref{A5}.
